# BlockView

BlockView is a comprehensive blockchain explorer built with React, TypeScript and Vite. It connects to any EVM compatible RPC endpoint and provides detailed information about blocks, transactions, accounts, tokens, and network activity.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js v6 for Web3 interactions
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **Package Manager**: Yarn with Plug'n'Play (or npm as fallback)

## Installation

This project uses **Yarn** with Plug'n'Play for dependency management. Install packages with:

```bash
yarn install
```

Alternatively, if you encounter issues with Yarn, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start a local dev server after installing dependencies:

npm run dev
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` with hot module reloading.

## Build

Build the project for production:

```bash
yarn build
# or  
npm run build
```
